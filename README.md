# Black History Memory-Game

I designed and programmed a simple memory game using art and imagery from black history. The game has three settings and timer for controlling difficulty.
jQuery is used for DOM manipulation. CSS flexbox were used for styling and  Illustrations/Art were designed in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.

This game was created to educate and amplify the history of the african disapora. The illustrations reflect a myriad of peoples throughout the history, reflecting various cultures and periods. Representation and diversity are an import part of inclusion and establishing more accepting and tolerant society.
